## Launch Files

### 1. Main Navigation (arap_navigation.launch.py)
This is the main launch file for running the complete navigation stack:
```bash
ros2 launch arap_robot_bringup arap_navigation.launch.py
```

### 2. Navigation Testing (nav2_test.launch.py)
For testing the navigation stack:
```bash
ros2 launch arap_robot_bringup nav2_test.launch.py
```

### 3. SLAM Testing (slam_test.launch.py)
For testing the SLAM functionality:
```bash
ros2 launch arap_robot_bringup slam_test.launch.py
```

### 4. Controller Loading (load_ros2_controllers.launch.py)
For loading and configuring ROS 2 controllers:
```bash
ros2 launch arap_robot_bringup load_ros2_controllers.launch.py
```

## Best Practices
